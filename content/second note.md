this is the second note.

it has a list, it lists the three things that come to my mind first:
	- [[the meadow behind my mother's past house]]
	- [[the hill that ends at my mother's current house]]
	- [[the little flakes of tree that float in the space between]]


I will elaborate further, please see the [[third note]]
