this is the story about the little flakes of tree.
I grew up around those trees.
The trees's home is the floating meadowy hill between my mother's past home and my mother's current home. Although located on top of a hill, the trees stand in a shallow damp swamp. There seems to be some sort of body of water. When I was a child, I used to go up there all the time. One of the two cats we owned accompanied me. Trash surfaced after heavy rain, old trash of years ago. An old door. Little brown bottles that once had medicine in it. Pieces of metal that no longer had purpose or shape. The constant risk of scraping my skin on sunken metal scraps. But in May, the trees would bloom and emit these little flakes that behaved like snow, being blown about by the faintest wind. It is the prettiest thing.
